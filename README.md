# Tab Freezer

is a Firefox and Chrome add-on based on the webextension API.

It is written with Chrome's callback API style which is also supported by Firefox.

Each browser has a different manifest.json template.

Feature: All new tabs opened by blacklisted domains are closed automatically.

The Chrome extension is available here:

but its use is somewhat limited, because Chrome is not able to force all links into tabs,
so you will have some popup windows.
