# Tab Freezer

is a Firefox and Chrome add-on based on the webextension API.

It is written in Chrome's callback API style which is also supported by Firefox.

Each browser has a different manifest.json template.

*Summary:* All new tabs and popups opened by blacklisted domains are closed automatically.

This add-on is able to block popups and ad-links where other ad-blockers "fail". Some sites put invsible layers over links, media control buttons and even full web pages to trick you on clicking in them. For browsers and ad-blockers those are legitimate links and clicks that won't be blocked.

With Tab Freezer you can block those popups. Just activate Tab Freezer on those pages and all opened popups, tabs and windows are closed automatically.
